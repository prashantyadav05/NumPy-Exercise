# NumPy
## What this Repository is for?
This is a collection of NumPy exercises from numpy mailing list, stack overflow, and numpy documentation. I've also created some problems myself. The goal of this collection is to offer a quick reference for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercises for those who teach.
